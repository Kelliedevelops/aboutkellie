            <header> <b> A little more about me </b>
            </header>
            <p> I am currently a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP)
            who is constantly collaborating with other disciplines, utilizing creativity, language, and problem solving throughout the day. In my current position, I enjoy assisting with technology-based administrative tasks, and have found a deep passion for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and the possibilities of development in this area.
            </p>
            <p> Looking further into this desire to know more about technology and software development, I began my journey at Thinkful and could not be more thrilled! </p>
            <p> Outside of being a developer, I spend a lot of time playing the ukulele, running, and being with my cat and dog. </p>
